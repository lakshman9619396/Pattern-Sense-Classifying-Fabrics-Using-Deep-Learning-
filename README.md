# Pattern-Sense-Classifying-Fabrics-Using-Deep-Learning-
This project focuses on the automatic classification of fabric patterns using deep learning techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns to recognize and categorize various fabric textures and designs such as floral, geometric, striped, abstract, and more.
